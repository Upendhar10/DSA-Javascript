## Problem Title

### Add Two Matrices

---

## Problem Description

You are given two matrices of the **same dimensions**. Add them element-wise and return the resulting matrix.

### ⚠️ Edge Cases to Consider

* Empty matrices
* Single element matrices
* Matrices with negative values

---

## Input Format

* Two matrices `A` and `B` of size `rows x cols`

---

## Output Format

* Resultant matrix after addition

---

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input:
A = [[1, 2]]
B = [[3, 4]]

Output:
[[4, 6]]

Explanation:
Each element is added position-wise.
```

### Example 2

```
Input:
A = []
B = []

Output:
[]

Explanation:
No elements to add.
```
